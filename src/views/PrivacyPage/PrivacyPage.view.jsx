            via one of our retail partners (this excludes rentals made via our
            marketplace at https://www.nomato.eu), we may assess your
            creditworthiness by supplying your personal information to credit
            reference agencies (CRAs). The CRA we currently supply information
            to is Experian.

                Full name, billing address, shipping address, date of birth
              </li>
            </ul>
            The credit reference agencies will provide us with information about
            you including public information, address data and information about
            your financial history.
            <p>
              If you enter a contract with us, we will also continue to exchange
              information with CRAs including successful payment or delays in
              payment of receivables. More information on Experian and the ways
              in which they use and share personal information can be found
