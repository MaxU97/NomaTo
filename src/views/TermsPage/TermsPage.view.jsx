                  If you offer storage space for hire, you must also ensure that
                  the space is accessible safely and legally, that it is secure
                  and free from leaks and/or excessive heat or cold. You will be
                  responsible for any damage to any of the buyer's items that
                  are left in your storage area.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will be responsible for any damage the borrower or any
                  other person may suffer as a result of any defect in the item
                  they have borrowed from you, or for any failure to comply with
                  the requirements in paragraph 10.2.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are free to agree any other terms on which you hire an
                  item to a borrower, including the price you wish to charge to
                  the borrower for hiring your item for the relevant hire period
                  (the "Hire Fee"). When you post items for hire on the Nomato
                  Service, you must ensure that the Hire Fee you advertise on
                  your listing is the total price payable for hiring your items,
                  including any applicable taxes or costs of delivery.

                <li>
                  Once you agree the terms on which you will lend an item to
                  a borrower, you must not try to amend those terms (including
                  the price) unless you have a valid, justifiable reason for
                  doing so and the borrower agrees to those amended terms.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can remove a listing or cancel your agreement to lend an
                  item to a borrower at any time up to 48 hours before the start
                  of the relevant hire period. If you cancel an agreement to
                  hire an item to a borrower less than 48 hours before the start
                  of the hire period, we may charge you a cancellation fee equal
                  to 30% of the relevant Hire Fee.

                  When you agree to hire an item with a lender,
                  the lender grants you a limited right to use that item for the
                  relevant hire period. This right is personal to you and you
                  are not allowed to give this right to any other person.

                  You are responsible for ensuring that:

                    <li>
                      you are legally allowed to use any item that you borrow

                    <li>
                      you comply with all applicable law when using the item;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      you comply with any reasonable directions provided by
                      the lender in order to use the item safely;

                    <li>
                      you return the item in the same condition as it was in
                      when you collected it from thelender (any reasonable wear
                      and tear excepted).

                </li>
                <li>
                  If you hire a storage space through the Nomato Service, you
                  must ensure that the items you store are not flammable,
                  dangerous or hazardous to people or animals, and do not
                  exceed £25,000 in value. You will be responsible for any
                  damage caused to the storage space, the lender or any other
                  person or property as a result of your use of any storage
                  space you hire through the Nomato Service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You are free to agree with the lender how you will return any
                  items you have hired to the lender; however, you must ensure
                  that return any items you have hired to the lenderbefore your
                  hire period ends.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You will be responsible for any loss of or damage to the item
                  you have hired. Please see paragraph 19 for more information
                  about how we handle disputes between borrowers and lenders,
                  including any if the item is damaged, lost or stolen.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can cancel a request to borrow an item at any time before
                  the request is accepted by the lender, or at any time up to 48
                  hours after the request is submitted, known as the ‘cooling
                  off period’. There is no cooling off period if the request is
                  within 48 hours of the start date. If you cancel before the
                  request has been accepted, or within the cooling off period
                  you will receive a full refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you fail to return an item by the agreed deadline you must
                  contact the lender and or Nomato to notify them as soon as you
                  are aware you are going to miss the deadline. You will also
                  need to book and pay for the extended time immediately.
                  The lender may not be able to accommodate the extension in
                  which case it is your responsibility to get the item(s) back
                  to the lender within a timeframe that suits the lender. If you
                  do not do so you will be liable to pay late fees, which will
                  be double the rental fee for the period the item was late
                  (“Late Fees”). You agree that Nomato can charge this amount
                  from your card or bank account without further permission.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you miss the agreed deadline for return and are
                  uncommunicative with the lender or Nomato, or we have reason
                  to believe you have caused damage to the item, you agree that
                  Nomato can take a holding deposit from your account up to the
                  full value of the items you have rented (“Holding Deposit”).
                  This deposit will be fully refundable, less any fees owed to
                  the company or lender, once the items are returned, replaced
                  or repaired. Otherwise the deposit will not be refunded.

              <strong>Resolving disputes between borrowers and lender</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We encourage users to resolve any disputes directly. If, as
                  a borrower, you have lost or damaged an item, you are
                  responsible for reimbursing the lender immediately for the
                  full value of repairing the item (if possible) or replacing
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are a lender, we may ask you to provide proof of
                  purchase, photos of any damage caused to an item, or any other
                  evidence to support your claim for reimbursement from a
                  borrower. Where you claim that a borrower has damaged an item,
                  we may also ask you to provide photos of your item taken
                  before it was provided to a borrower, to support your claim
                  that any damage was caused by the borrower (and was not
                  present at the start of the hire period).
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event that a borrower and a lender are unable to
                  resolve a dispute between them directly, they can ask us to
                  mediate the dispute. If we do mediate a dispute, we may charge
                  a fee of up to 30% of any amounts that we, the lender and
                  the borrower determine are payable by the borrower to
                  compensate the lender for any loss or damage to the item. We
                  will charge this amount to the borrower in addition to any
                  amounts the borrower is required to pay to
                  the lender (together known as the “Settlement Fee”). If Nomato
                  mediates the dispute you agree to accept Nomato’s conclusion
                  and pay any amount which Nomato determines you are liable for.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you owe Nomato or another user money through the terms of
                  these Terms of Service you agree to pay the sum promptly and
                  not more than 48 hours from it being requested. In the event
                  that you do not pay the owed money within this timeframe,
                  Nomato pay debit this amount from your card. In agreeing to
                  these Terms you agree to allow us to do so and waive your
                  right to chargeback this transaction with your bank.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <strong>Resolving disputes between buyers and sellers</strong>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  We encourage users to resolve any disputes directly. If, as a
                  buyer, you have received an item which you feel is not in the
                  condition that was advertised, or your item never arrived,
                  please contact the lender directly to try to reach a
                  resolution. If the item does not arrive in the condition
                  advertised, the seller will be responsible for providing a
                  refund or replacement according to the buyers preference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you as a buyer claim on our guarantee, we may ask you to
                  provide photos or videos showing the condition of the item
                  upon arrival or any other evidence to support your claim for
                  reimbursement from the seller. If as a seller you wish to
                  contest such a claim, we may ask for evidence of the condition
                  of the item upon sending such as photos or videos.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In the event that a buyer and seller are unable to resolve a
                  dispute between them directly, they can ask us to mediate the
                  dispute. If we do mediate a dispute, we may charge a fee of up
                  to 30% of any amounts that we determine are payable by the
                  buyer to compensate for an incorrectly advertised item. We
                  will charge this amount to the seller.

              <ol>
                <li>
                  In the event that you are unable to recover the cost of
                  repairing or replacing an item or the estimated value of the
                  item, we may reimburse you any such amounts provided you meet
                  the criteria laid out in the "Lender Guarantee", which you can
                  read in full at LINK . Further details of the Lender Guarantee

                <li>
                  If you are a lender, if we agree to reimburse you under
                  the Lender Guarantee, you must inform the borrower that any
                  amounts owed to the lender will now be owed to us.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you are a borrower, any payment we may make to
                  the lender under the Lender Guarantee will not affect your
                  obligation to pay for the items that have been lost, stolen or
                  damaged, but this obligation will be owed to us, rather than
                  the lender.

                  Closing the Nomato website might not close any Account you

                <li>
                  We may immediately end your use of the Nomato a Service if you

                  We may also withdraw any part of the Nomato Service at any

                  affect your usage of the Nomato Service.

                  If you or we end your use of the Nomato Service or we withdraw
                  Nomato Service as described in this section, we may delete
                  your User Content, any other information that you have
                  uploaded to the Nomato Service or any other information we

                  the Nomato Service or to access our content or your User
                  Content. You should therefore ensure that you keep a copy of
                  any information or content you use on the Nomato Service, as
                  well as your User Content, as we will not offer you
                  compensation for any losses you might suffer if you lose your
                  rights to access and use the Nomato Service or any such

                  The termination of your use of the Nomato Service and the

                <li>
                  While we will do our best to ensure that the Nomato website
                  itself is of a reasonable standard and quality and matches any
                  descriptions we have provided you, the Nomato website and any
                  other portion of the Nomato Service may contain some content
                  owned or developed by third parties. As we do not own or
                  produce such third party content, we cannot be responsible for
                  it in any way.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In addition, due to the nature of the Internet and technology,
                  the Nomato Service is unfortunately provided on an "as
                  available" and "as is" basis. This means that we are unable to
                  promise that your use of the Nomato Service will be
                  uninterrupted, without delays, error-free or meet your
                  expectations and we do not give any commitment relating to the
                  performance or availability of the Nomato Service in these
                  Terms and Conditions and, to the extent we are able to do so,
                  we exclude any commitments that may be implied by law.

                  In the event of a claim arising out of the provision of the
                  Nomato Service, our responsibility to you will never be more
                  than the amount you have paid us in the 12 months prior to the
                  claim arising and, in the event that you have not paid us any
                  money, we shall have no responsibility whatsoever to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In every case, we will never be responsible for any loss or

                  The above does not affect your rights under the applicable law

                  in the first instance please contact us at info@nomato.com and
                  attempt to resolve the dispute with us informally.

                <li>
                  In the unlikely event that we have not been able to resolve a

              <ol>
                <li>
                  We are constantly updating and improving the Nomato Service to
                  try and find ways to provide you with new and innovative
                  features and services. Improvements and updates are also made
                  to reflect changing technologies, tastes, behaviours and the
                  way people use the Internet and the Nomato Service.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In order to do this, we may need to update, reset, stop
                  offering and/or supporting a particular part of the Nomato
                  Service, or feature relating to the Nomato Service ("changes
                  to the Nomato Service"). These changes to the Nomato Service
                  may affect your past activities on the Nomato Service,
                  features that you use, your User Content and any other
                  information you submit to the Nomato Service ("Service
                  Elements"). Any changes to the Nomato Service could involve
                  your Service Elements being deleted or reset.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You agree that a key characteristic of the Nomato Service is
                  that changes to the Nomato Service will take place over time
                  and this is an important basis on which we grant you access to
                  the Nomato Service. Once we have made changes to any part of
                  the Nomato Service, your continued use of the Nomato Service
                  will show that you have accepted any changes to the Nomato
                  Service. You are always free to stop using the Nomato Service.

                  We may revise these Terms and Conditions from time to time but
                  the most current version will always be

                </li>
                <li>
                  Changes will usually occur because of new features being added
                  to the Nomato Service, changes in the law or where we need to
                  clarify our position on something.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Normally, we will try to give you some warning before the new
                  terms become effective. However, sometimes changes will need
                  to be made immediately and if this happens we will not give
                  you any notice.

                  the written terms of our agreement with you for the provision
                  of the Nomato Service. If part of these Terms and Conditions

                  If you do not comply with these Terms and Conditions and we do

                  Latvian law will apply to all disputes and the interpretation
                  of these Terms and Conditions. If we need to apply to court to
                  enforce any part of these Terms and Conditions against you or
                  resolve any other dispute between us arising from or related
                  to your use of the Nomato Service, we will initially seek to
                  apply to the Latvia courts. This does not affect your rights
                  under the law of the country in which you are resident,
                  including your right to have a dispute in relation to your use
                  of the Nomato Service heard in the courts of that country.
